This project aimed to analyze Chennai's weather patterns and forecast future temperatures using historical data. I implemented a time series analysis involving data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of trends like moving averages. Advanced models, including SARIMAX and LSTM, were employed to predict weather patterns accurately. This project enhanced the accuracy of short-term weather predictions, providing valuable insights for urban planning and climate monitoring.
